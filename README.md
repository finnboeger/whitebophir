## Running your own instance of WB

If you have your own web server, and want to run a private instance of WB on it, you can. It should be very easy to get it running on your own server.

### Running the code

First, download the sources:
```
git clone git@github.com:rdbeach/wb.git
cd wb
```

Then [install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v10.0 or superior)
if you don't have it already, then install WBO's dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the server:
```
PORT=5001 npm start
```

This will run WB directly on your machine, on port 5001, without any isolation from the other services.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience an issue or want to propose a new feature in WB, please [open a github issue](https://github.com/rdbeach/wb/issues/new).
